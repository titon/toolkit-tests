# Titon Toolkit #

This project contains full blown in-browser testing suite for all Toolkit plugins and their configurations. The tests will always use the latest Toolkit development code, but you could always swap in the CSS and JS files manually to test for yourself.

This project requires a running webserver (Apache, nginx) as AJAX requests are utilized. When ready, simply clone the project and open up the `index.html` file to start testing!
