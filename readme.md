# Toolkit #

This project contains full blown in-browser demonstrations for all Toolkit plugins and their configurations.
The tests will always use the latest Toolkit development code, but you could always swap in the CSS and JS files
manually to test for yourself.

Simply clone the project and open up the `index.html` file to start testing!
